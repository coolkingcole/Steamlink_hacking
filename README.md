# Steamlink_hacking

## Prior work
It was already known that placing a flash drive in a steamlink with a specific file structure is how the Steamlink can be updated (https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3966-EFLV-7805) or ssh can be enabled with a non-empty file ```/steamlink/config/system/enable_ssh.txt``` (https://github.com/garbear/kodi-steamlink)

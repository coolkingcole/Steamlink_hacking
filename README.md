# Steamlink Hacking

## Prior work
It was already known that placing a flash drive in a steamlink with a specific file structure is how the Steamlink can be updated (https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3966-EFLV-7805) or ssh can be enabled with a non-empty file `/steamlink/config/system/enable_ssh.txt` (https://github.com/garbear/kodi-steamlink). 

## My work
If the steamlink is booted with a flashdrive with the `enable_ssh.txt` file on it in the right place you can get root ssh access with the password steamlink123. This made working with the steamlink very easy. 

I was able to find another special directory structure that can be placed on a flashdrive that allows any bash script to be ran. The init.d script at `/etc/init.d/startup/S01config` at line 121 is-
```
        # Run factory test if needed
        FACTORY_TEST=${OVERRIDE}/factory_test/run.sh
        if [ -f ${FACTORY_TEST} ]; then
                sh ${FACTORY_TEST}
        fi
```

A file called run.sh placed on a flashdrive at `/steamlink/factory_test/` will be ran at boot by `init.d`. init.d scripts are ran right after the root filesystem is mounted, this makes it very easy to drop files onto the system and maintain persistence if needed.

## POC
### Goal
Establish persistence and execute code on Windows hosts connected to the steamlink with UAC bypass

### How it works

#### Dropping
The file I place here for my POC is `run.sh` this is a very simple script that copies a compiled binary placed in `/steamlink/config/keyboard_emu` and a script `/steamlink/config/typer_back_door.sh` into the home directory of a user named steam on the steamlink. Then the run.sh bash script appends `/home/steam/typer_back_door.sh &` to the end of one of the init.d startup scripts so that `typer_back_door.sh` will be ran in the background each boot.

#### persistence
`typer_back_door.sh` just waits until `streaming_client` proccess is ran on the system which is launched when the steamlink is connected to a Steam instance on a remote PC then excutes the `/home/steam/keyboard_emu` binary.

#### Windows Execution  
`keyboard_emu` Does as the name implies, it emulates key presses as if a keyboard is plugged into the steamlink. With this capability the big picture "sandbox" is escaped and we pop calc.exe. This is done by sending key presses directly to `/dev/uinput`. `ALT+ENTER` escapes the "sandbox" and `WIN+X` then `I` Opens powershell as the current user. If we instead press `A` after `WIN+X` an admin powershell instance will be launched and will have to add key presses to navigate the UAC prompt.
